Dekrispator
===========

Transform your STM32F4 Discovery board into an experimental music synthesizer or autonomous noise box with USB MIDI Host function for interaction !

**Usage**

Flash your board with "dekrispator.hex" (in Release folder) and enjoy hours and hours of sweet music coming of it ! Sounds can be loud so beware !

When powering up the board, the synth starts in "demo mode" unless you press and maintain a little the user button before power. In that case the synth enters "user mode".

*Demo mode* : The synth works on its own, sounds are perpetually changing. If you press the user button, sounds and effects stop always changing and the red LED lights on : the synth parameters are frozen. Press once again the user button and the red LED lights off : unfreeze.

*User mode* : Connect an USB MIDI controller (like Korg NanoKontrol...) to the board's micro USB connector and control the synth.
The MIDI mapping of the synth controls are in MIDI_mapping.ods file. I nearly used the factory settings of Korg NanoKontrol V1 (some momentary/toggle buttons modified).

The MIDI USB Host driver is rudimentary and has still some issues !

The orange LED reflects the CPU usage : when it's dim CPU gets overloaded.

Ready to use files are in Ressources folder.

**Building from source :**

I've used (Windows):

* Eclipse Kepler
* GNU ARM plugin for Eclipse
* Yagarto tools for make, rm, ...
* GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors (gcc 4.8 2013 q4)
* STM32 ST-LINK Utility for flashing the microcontroller

Simple command line :  
Go into Release folder and type make (with Cygwin terminal).

Compiles also on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) !

Fixed to mk files to compile on OSX from console, just type:

`make`
`arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary Dekrispator.elf Dekrispator.bin`
`st-flash write Dekrispator.bin 0x8000000`
